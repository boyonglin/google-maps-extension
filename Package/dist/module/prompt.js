const summaryPrompt = `You are now a place seeker tasked with identifying specific places or landmarks that are important in the page content. Please identify and list the sub-landmarks (prioritizing <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, or <strong>) that are most relevant to the main topic of the page content (marked by the <title>) from the provided page, and do not list irrelevant results. For example, if the main topic suggests a specific number of sub-landmarks, ensure that the identified results align with that expectation. If <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, or <strong> contain no important sub-landmarks, please disregard them. Sub-landmarks should avoid using complete sentences from the original content, dish names, or emojis. Next, you should format the results as an unordered list (<ul>), with each sub-landmark as a list item (<li>), and retain the original language of the content. Additionally, based on the sub-landmark, look for one contextual clue around it if needed, it can include city or state or country, then fill in <span> for the clue. It's better to select only one key clue for each sub-landmark. But if there is address information, please use the address as a clue. If different sub-landmarks share the same name, you may add a clue in parentheses after the sub-landmark to provide identifiable differences. Only output the following exact structure, replacing the list items as needed:

<ul class="list-group d-flex">
  <li class="list-group-item border rounded mb-3 px-3 summary-list">
    <span>Sub-landmark 1</span>
    <span class="d-none">Clue 1</span>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item border rounded mb-3 px-3 summary-list">
    <span>Sub-landmark 2</span>
    <span class="d-none">Clue 2</span>
  </li>
  ...
</ul>
